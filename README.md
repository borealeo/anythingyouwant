Hello

Q1) There are a few that can be used. They are: close, closes, closed, fixes, fixed, *resolve, resolved.

Q2) I believe you can close mulitple issues in a single PR. You would have to preface each issue with a "fixing" keyword.

Q3) A classic way of using a map would be mapping through arrays. 
    Why it is so useful in dealing with these sorts of collections is that it itself is a collection of elements. It on it's own is an object that 
    iterates through it's elements and returns key and value pairs


    Maybe conside a array of var numbers = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] or something. 
    
   
    var addedArray = numbers.map(addOne)
      
      
     function addOne(number){
        return number + 1;
       }
       
      document.write(addedArray);
      
      
   I believe when a function accepts a call back into a function that returns a promise, it is called a transformation.
